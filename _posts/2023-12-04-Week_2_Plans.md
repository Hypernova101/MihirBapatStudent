<p style="color:white;">Throughout this week, I plan on completing the assignment, which includes trying to create my first few blog posts, including regular posts, hacks, and tangibles. However, I don't think this will take me the whole week, so I will try to finish the snake game, and improve the overall look of my website. Like my partner, we want to incorporate fun into our posts, so we will try and see if we can add in some "fun" elements to our posts, by expirimenting with Javascript to help prepare us for next week.</p>
