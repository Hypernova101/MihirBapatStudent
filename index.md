*My about me picture*

This picture shows a lot about my life. It shows my favorite sports teams, Liverpool FC, Mumbai Indians, and the Indian National Cricket Team. In my free time, I like to play soccer and play the piano, hence the images there. I like to play Fortnite on my Nintendo Switch with Yash Parikh and code; I want to be a Computer Scientist when I grow up. Finally, I like Math a lot and I added a picture of myself. 

## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
